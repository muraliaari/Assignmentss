        <p>React is a JS library that helps create Active web pages easily. Now active web pages are specific pages that behave according to their user. For example, letâ€™s take the GeeksforGeeks webpage, the webpage acts differently with each user. User A might write some code in C in the Light Theme while another User may write a Python code in the Dark Theme all at the same time. This dynamic behavior that partially depends upon the user itself makes the webpage an Active webpage. Now how can this be related to Updation? Updation is the phase where the states and props of a component are updated followed by some user events such as clicking, pressing a key on the keyboard, etc. The following are the descriptions of functions that are invoked at different points of Updation phase.</p>
